# Improvement Tasks for Simple Socket Server with Thread Pool

Checklist of actionable improvement tasks for the simple-socket-server-threadpool project. Tasks are organized by category and priority.

## Architecture Improvements

1. [ ] Implement a proper HTTP request parser to handle different HTTP methods and paths
2. [ ] Create a request/response abstraction to decouple socket handling from business logic
3. [ ] Implement a router/handler mechanism to direct requests to appropriate handlers
4. [ ] Add configuration management for server settings (port, thread pool size, etc.)
5. [ ] Implement graceful shutdown with timeout for ongoing requests
6. [ ] Create a proper logging system instead of using System.out.println
7. [ ] Add metrics collection for monitoring server performance
8. [ ] Implement connection pooling for database or external service connections
9. [ ] Add support for HTTPS/TLS connections

## Code Quality Improvements

10. [ ] Add proper resource management with try-with-resources for all I/O operations
11. [ ] Implement comprehensive error handling with appropriate error responses
12. [ ] Remove commented-out code in WorkerRunnable
13. [ ] Add input validation for constructor parameters
14. [ ] Make fields final where appropriate
15. [ ] Add Javadoc comments to all public methods and classes
16. [ ] Implement unit tests for all components
17. [ ] Add integration tests for the server
18. [ ] Implement consistent exception handling strategy
19. [ ] Add thread naming for better debugging
20. [ ] Implement request/response logging

## Performance Improvements

21. [ ] Add configurable connection timeout
22. [ ] Implement request rate limiting
23. [ ] Add support for non-blocking I/O (NIO) for better scalability
24. [ ] Implement connection keep-alive support
25. [ ] Add request queuing with configurable limits
26. [ ] Optimize thread pool configuration based on workload characteristics
27. [ ] Implement backpressure mechanisms for high load scenarios

## Build and Deployment Improvements

28. [ ] Add dependencies for logging (SLF4J + implementation)
29. [ ] Add testing dependencies (JUnit, Mockito)
30. [ ] Configure Maven plugins for building executable JAR
31. [ ] Add Docker support with appropriate Dockerfile
32. [ ] Implement CI/CD pipeline configuration
33. [ ] Add Maven profiles for different environments (dev, test, prod)
34. [ ] Configure code quality tools (Checkstyle, SpotBugs, etc.)
35. [ ] Add code coverage reporting

## Documentation Improvements

36. [ ] Create README.md with project overview and usage instructions
37. [ ] Add API documentation for endpoints
38. [ ] Create architecture diagram
39. [ ] Document performance characteristics and limitations
40. [ ] Add contributor guidelines
41. [ ] Create changelog for tracking version changes
42. [ ] Document configuration options

## Security Improvements

43. [ ] Implement request validation to prevent injection attacks
44. [ ] Add security headers to HTTP responses
45. [ ] Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms
46. [ ] Add CORS support for web clients
47. [ ] Implement input sanitization
48. [ ] Add protection against common attacks (DoS, brute force)
49. [ ] Implement secure configuration handling (for credentials, etc.)
50. [ ] Add security scanning to the build process
